Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It accelerates the delivery of your web content, including static and dynamic content, to end-users across the globe by caching content at edge locations close to the user's location.

Parameters:
1. Origin Configuration(Required): Specifies the origin(s) from which CloudFront retrieves your content. This can be an Amazon S3 bucket, an HTTP server (such as an EC2 instance), or a custom origin (e.g., a load balancer). This parameter is essential for CloudFront to know where to fetch your content from.
2. Aliases (Alternate Domain Names)(Optional): Specifies the custom domain names (CNAMEs) that you want to associate with the CloudFront distribution. This allows you to serve content from your own domain names (e.g., example.com) rather than using the CloudFront domain name (e.g., d12345.cloudfront.net).
3. Logging Configuration(Required): Specifies whether to enable access logging for the CloudFront distribution and the settings for the logging bucket and prefix. Logging configuration allows you to capture detailed access logs for analysis and monitoring purposes.
4. Restrictions and Security Policies(Required): Defines restrictions and security policies for the CloudFront distribution, such as IP address whitelisting, geo-restriction, and integration with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) for web application protection. Security policies help protect your content and applications from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
5. Price Class and Geo Restriction(Required): Defines the CloudFront price class (e.g., US, US and Europe, All Edge Locations) and geo-restriction settings (e.g., whitelist or blacklist specific countries) for the distribution. Price class and geo-restriction settings help control costs and restrict access to your content based on geographic location.

Terraform Configuration:

1. Review Configuration: Review the main.tf file to ensure it matches your requirements. You can adjust variables such as region, accesskey, password etc.
2. Initialize Terraform: Navigate to the directory containing the Terraform configuration files and initialize Terraform(terraform init).
3. Create Plan: Generate a Terraform execution plan to preview the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure(terraform plan).
4. Apply Plan: If the plan looks good, apply it to provision or update your ECR resources(terraform apply).
5. Confirm Changes: Confirm the changes when prompted by Terraform. Once confirmed, Terraform will apply the plan and make the necessary changes to your infrastructure.
